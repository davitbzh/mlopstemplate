    "Fraudulent transactions can differ from regular ones in many different ways. Typical red flags would for instance be a large transaction volume/frequency in the span of a few hours. It could also be the case that elderly people in particular are targeted by fraudsters. To facilitate model learning you will create additional features based on these patterns. In particular, you will create two types of features:\n",
    "1. **Features that aggregate data from different data sources**. This could for instance be the age of a customer at the time of a transaction, which combines the `birthdate` feature from `profiles.csv` with the `datetime` feature from `transactions.csv`.\n",
